# Hospital-Readmission-Risk-Analysis-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospital Readmission Data



##  Project Overview
Hospital readmissions are a significant concern in the healthcare industry as they impact patient outcomes and increase healthcare costs.  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the factors associated with **hospital patient readmissions**.

The aim is to explore patterns, trends, and relationships in the data that may influence readmission risk.

---

##  Problem Statement
Hospital readmission occurs when a patient is admitted again within a short period after discharge.Identifying factors related to readmissions can help improve patient care and reduce unnecessary hospital visits.
This project analyzes patient and hospital-related data to gain insights into readmission behavior.

---

##  Dataset Description
- Patient-level hospital admission data
- Includes demographic information, medical details, and hospital stay characteristics
- Target variable indicates whether a patient was readmitted

*Note: The dataset is used for learning and analysis purposes.*

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
The notebook includes the following EDA steps:
1.  Data loading and initial inspection
2.  Handling missing values
3.  Data cleaning and data type corrections
4.  Univariate analysis
5.  Bivariate analysis with respect to readmission
6.  Visualizations to support insights

---

##  Key Insights
- Certain patient categories show higher readmission rates
- Length of hospital stay shows a relationship with readmission
- Some medical conditions are associated with repeat admissions

*(Detailed analysis and visualizations are available in the notebook.)*

##  Tools & Libraries Used
✔ Python

✔ Pandas

✔ NumPy

✔ Matplotlib

✔ Plotly

✔ Seaborn

✔ Jupyter Notebook

##  How to View the Project
- Open the file **Hospital_Re-admission.ipynb** directly in GitHub  
- Or download the notebook and run it in **Jupyter Notebook**

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a clear understanding of hospital readmission patterns and highlights important factors influencing readmission risk. The analysis can serve as a foundation for further modeling or healthcare-related studies.
